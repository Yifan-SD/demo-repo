//TL;DR â€“ How to Exit Vim
Press ESC once (sometimes twice)
Make sure you are using the English input method
The next step depends on the current status and your expectations:
If you didn't make any changes, type :q and press Enter/return
If you made some changes and would like to keep them, type :wq and press Enter/return
If you made some changes and would rather discard them, type :q! and press Enter/return
